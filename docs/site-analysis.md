# Footprint Site Re-Analysis (2026-02-13)

## 1. Information Architecture
- Core pages found:
  - `/` Home
  - `/our-doctor`
  - `/office`
  - `/services`
  - `/new-patients`
  - `/blog`
  - `/request-appointment`
- Global sections:
  - top notice banner
  - primary navigation + request appointment CTA
  - office contact metadata and social links
  - footer quick-links and office details

## 2. Content Strategy Observations
- Homepage acts as a conversion page:
  - hero CTA
  - quick symptom/service shortcuts
  - condition cards
  - doctor trust block
  - office/hours/map details
- Service page is a hybrid:
  - long list of conditions
  - educational snippets for common diagnoses
- Request page is a structured intake form:
  - preferred date
  - contact data
  - referral source attribution
  - appointment notes

## 3. Design System Observations
- Dominant palette: teal + gold accents.
- Serif-forward headings with simple sans body text.
- Utility-style card blocks and repeated call-to-action pattern.
- Heavy use of iconography to support quick scanning.
